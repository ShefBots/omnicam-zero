                      NO-TRAIN GPL LICENSE
                     Version 1, 14 April 2024

The software found with this license is distributed under the rules of
the GNU General Public License (Version 3 [29 June 2007], supplied as
'LICENSE-GPL' alongside this document). However, this license explicitly
denies the use of the associated source code as training material for any
kind of machine learning or other AI (artificial intelligence) algorithm
such that new or modified code can be produced or generated without
requiring the affixation of this license to the generated code.

Any entity, business or individual, who wishes to use the source code
of this software product must affix this (and the associated GNU GPL)
license to generated or otherwise produced code that has been created
using the source code provided here.

Rational:
The GNU GPL license permits use of source code for any purpose, provided
that suitable steps are taken to ensure that the net good achieved by that
code is not locked behind a single company or individual. To allow modern
code-generating AI systems to launder this good will for private use while
discarding the essence of the GPL license goes against this goal, and the
NO-TRAIN GPL license aims to rectify that.
